# Spectrum Data Science and Machine Learning Internship Project Report
-> Data Science and Machine Learning Internship at Spectrum Club CET,Bhubaneswar.This is a work from home basis Internship provided by Spectrum Club, CET College.

-> In this Internship program we have done data preprocessing, data visualization,data cleaning, data manipulation and prediction by using Machine Learning Algorithm.

-> Different Libraries used for the project is:

    1. Numpy
    
    2. Pandas
    
    3. Matplotlib
    
    4. seaborn
    
    5. sklearn
    
    6. Statsmodel.api
   
-> Task- 1   :  In this task a dictionary was given and we have to perform operation on this dictionary by using Numpy library and perform data visualization by using Matplotlib library and perform some statistical operations( Mean,Median,Maz,Min).

-> Task- 2   : In this task a "Student" dataset was given and we perform several operations-

                1. Creating Dataframe from CSV file
               
                2. Creating a new column from existing columns and deleting columns
               
                3. Handling categorical values
               
                4. Data Visualization : Scatter Plot, Box Plot
          
-> Task- 3   : In this task we have use  Machine Learning along with several operations-
              
                1. Conversion of nominal values into numeric values using LabelEncoder/OneHotEncoder
                
                2. Convert the data into Training and Testing data
                
                3. Model Selection
                
                4. Calculate the accuracy of model
                
                5. use backward elimination method to find the most important attributes 
                
                6. Use of different Machine Learning Models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
                
1. Linear Regression

    Results:
    
          Train Score:  0.97542

          Test Score:  0.9628

          Predict Score:  0.9976
    
 2. Decision Tree Regression
     
     Results:
     
           Train Score:  1.0

          Test Score:  0.9504

          Predict Score:  1.0
 
  2. Random Forest Regression
     
     Results:
     
           Train Score: 0.9961

          Test Score:  0.9693

          Predict Score:  0.9973
          
 Future Scope :  We can deploy the model so that it take inputs and predict the output
